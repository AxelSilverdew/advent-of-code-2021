# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

I'm attempting this year's AoC in Rust.
I don't know how far I'll get, but I'm gonna try to have fun with it.

Each day's solutions are in their own module and they're all being executed from the main.rs.

To see the output, just `git clone` this repo and do a `cargo run`.
